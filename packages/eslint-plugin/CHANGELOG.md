### Patch Changes

- üêû Fix: Change eslint plugin project to @fuels/eslint-plugin to be able to load as `plugin:@fuels/base`
- üöÄ Feat: Add custom configurations on eslint plugin to be able to handle different types of projects with the same plugin

To use the base configuration you can extends like this:

```json
{
  "extends": ["plugin:@fuels/base"]
}
```

You also provide a configuration for NextJS projects:

```json
{
  "extends": ["plugin:@fuels/next"]
}
```

Or you can pick some specific configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@fuels/typescript",
    "plugin:@fuels/react",
    "plugin:@fuels/jest"
  ]
}
```
